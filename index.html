				<p>
					I was born in Los Angeles County in the city of Panorama. I was raised in Valencia, home to Six Flags Magic Mountain. I graduated with a Bachelor's Degee in Accountancy from California State University, Northridge. After which, I moved to San Diego.

					My hobbies include riding motorcycles and traveling. I own a Suzuki GSXR 1000 and have reached a top speed of 179 mph. I lived in Uruguay for two years and Germany for one year. In the process, I learned to speak Spanish fluently and a little German.
